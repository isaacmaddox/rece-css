# rece-css
## Basic CSS Library

Rece-css is a basic, open-source stylesheet that I have developed in order to help developers. If you are working on a quick website that is mainly comprised of text and requires little to no special layout, this is the library for you.

I developed this library with usability in mind, so no classes are necessary for the library to work. However, some classes are available to allow customization.
On the home page for this library, I have created a simple demo of all the elements supported by the library; however, more detailed documentation is available in the docs. To access the library, go to [this website](https://rece-css.netlify.app/)
